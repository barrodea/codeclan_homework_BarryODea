# Learning Objectives<br>

* Practice making plots with ggplot2
* Create your own theme and use it with plots

# Background

QikBit is a start-up company producing low cost fitness trackers. Their flagship product, the KwikBit Unit1 (spot the mistake on the patent form) reproduces the functionality of the best-in-class commercial fitness trackers, but is cheap to make.  They are currently preparing to pitch to a potential investor and require a selection of charts to include in their presentation and promotional materials.

# Data

The data for this assignment is provided in the `CodeClanData` package.

* `qb_revenue_breakdown`
* `qb_monthly_sales`
* `qb_competitors`
* `qb_device_data`

Take a little time before you start to familiarise yourself with the data.

# MVP

## Part 1

1. Take the data in the dataset `qb_revenue_breakdown` and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(CodeClanData)

revenue_breakdown <- `qb_revenue_breakdown`

ggplot(revenue_breakdown) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Product, y = Revenue, fill = Year), stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Revenue source for 2018 and 2019") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "col_scheme") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```



2.	Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside `qb_monthly_sales`, but you will need to use `filter()` or `subset()` (base `R)`.

```{r}
monthly_sales <- `qb_monthly_sales`
monthly_sales_kwitbit_unit1 <- monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")
ggplot(monthly_sales_kwitbit_unit1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Amount)) +
  labs(title = "Monthly Sales for KwikBit Unit 1 Sales",
       subtitle = "Data taken from monthly sales data ",
       y = "Revenue",
       x = "Months") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "col_scheme") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```


3.	Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in `qb_monthly_sales`.								
```{r}
monthly_revenue_and_cost <- monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")
ggplot(monthly_revenue_and_cost) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Amount, colour = Cashflow)) +
  labs(title = "Revenue and Costs for last year",
       subtitle = "Data taken from monthly sales data",
       y = "Revenue",
       x = "Months") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "col_scheme") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```
4.	Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot (use `geom_area`). This data is in `qb_competitors`.

```{r}
competitors <- `qb_competitors`

ggplot(competitors, aes(x = Year, fill = Company)) +
  geom_area(aes(y = Revenue, stat = "bin")) +
  labs(title = "Annual Sales of personal trackers over the last 5 years",
       subtitle = "Data taken from information gathered on competitors") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "col_scheme") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```


5. Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines.

```{r}
ggplot(competitors, aes(x = Year, fill = Company)) +
  geom_area(aes(y = Revenue, stat = "bin")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Revenue)) +
  labs(title = "Data points for Annual Sales of personal trackers over the last 5 years",
       subtitle = "Data taken from information gathered on competitors") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "col_scheme") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```

6. Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in `qb_device_data`.

```{r}
device_data <- `qb_device_data`
device_data %>% 
  distinct(device)

ggplot(device_data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = hours, y = counts, group = hours, colour = device))
```


## Part 2 

Take the plots that you produced in part one and now polish them by:

1. Adding appropriate labels
2. Changing the scales and coordinates when appropriate.
3. Applying a unified theme, which is described below:
  * Graphs should have white backgrounds, and use colour sparingly.
  * There should be faint grid lines.
  * Font sizes should be ~12pt although titles should be slightly larger and axis labels can be slightly smaller. 
  * All plots should use colours from the following company colour scheme.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("palette.JPG")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
col_scheme <- c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040")
```


# Extension

Try out different ways of plotting these three datasets. Which graphs do you think are particularly effective at showing QikBit's success?
